# DATA 512 A Au 20: Human-Centered Data Science
# A4: Final Project Preliminary Proposal

  
  
## Project Proposal

This project explores the relationship between gender and sports in the US to learn if women are given the same opportunities as men. I will be focusing the research on the collegiate level, hoping I can later extrapolate my findings to the professional level.

## Data

The dataset I'll use for this project contains 2074 US educational institutions with athletic programs that received federal student financial aid for the 2018-19 academic year. It has data on students' athletic participation and staffing, revenues, and expenses by men's and women's teams.  
  
The dataset can be found in the [Download Data](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/datafile/list) page of the [Equity in Athletics Data Analysis](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/) website. The chosen data can be found under the year 2019, with the title "All data combined for academic year 2018-19". This will download a zip file with four files, of which I will use "EADA_2019.xlsx" and "EADA_2019.doc" (data and description, respectively). The dataset belongs under the [Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act](https://www2.ed.gov/finaid/prof/resources/athletics/eada.html) and is released to the public by the US Department of Education.
