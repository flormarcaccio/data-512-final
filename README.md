## Abstract

This project explores the relationship between gender and sports in the US, intending to learn if women are given the same opportunities as men. The focus of the research are institutions that participate in the NCAA divisions at the collegiate level.

I used a combination of data visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the importance of financial aid for women's teams, the difference in athletic participation by gender, and the opportunities given to female coaches compared to male coaches.

I obtained discouraging results for women looking to participate in sports at the collegiate level. For athletes, there are fewer athletic positions in comparison to men's teams. Also, there are fewer opportunities for female coaches, and the jobs at women's teams that they have access to tend to have lower salaries than coaches in men's teams. From the results, I was able to showcase some parallels to what is happening on a professional level.



## Data

The dataset I'll use for this project contains information about US educational institutions with athletic programs that received federal student financial aid for the 2018-19 academic year. It has data on students' athletic participation, staffing, and finances by men's and women's teams.  
  
The dataset can be found in the [Download Data](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/datafile/list) page of the [Equity in Athletics Data Analysis](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/) website. The chosen data can be found under the year 2019, with the title "All data combined for academic year 2018-19". This will download a zip file with four files, of which I will use ["EADA_2019.xlsx"](data/EADA_2019.xlsx) and "[EADA_2019.doc"](data/EADA_2019.doc) (data and description, respectively). The dataset belongs under the [Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act](https://www2.ed.gov/finaid/prof/resources/athletics/eada.html) and is released to the public by the US Department of Education.
