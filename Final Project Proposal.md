## <a name="motivation"></a> Motivation and problem statement

The main goal of this project is to explore the relationship between gender and sports in the US.  I would like to understand if men have any advantages over women when it comes to institutional support. To narrow down the scope of this research, I will be focusing on collegiate sports, expecting that what I found here could be a fair representation of what is also happening on the professional level.  

Sports are a considerable aspect of college life, which influences many students' decisions on whether or not to attend a specific institution. Thus, I think it would be interesting to see if men and women teams are treated equally and fairly among US universities.  
  
After completing the project, I hope that I will learn whether women are given the same opportunities as men when it comes to collegiate sports. I will possibly obtain critical insights that can be also be associated with professional sports, to be explored in a later analysis.


## <a name="data"></a> Data

 
The dataset I'll use for this project contains 2074 US educational institutions with athletic programs that received federal student financial aid for the 2018-19 academic year. It has data on students' athletic participation, and staffing, revenues, and expenses by men's and women's teams.  
  
The dataset can be found in the [Download Data](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/datafile/list) page of the [Equity in Athletics Data Analysis](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/) website. The chosen data can be found under the year 2019, with the title "All data combined for academic year 2018-19". This will download a zip file with four files, of which I will use "EADA_2019.xlsx" and "EADA_2019.doc" (data and description, respectively). The dataset belongs under the [Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act](https://www2.ed.gov/finaid/prof/resources/athletics/eada.html) and was released to the public by the US Department of Education.  

This dataset is suitable for addressing the project goal as I can link the amount of financial aid that women's and men's teams receive with how much university support they have. This will potentially disclose any unfair or biased treatment.  

One possible ethics issue that I see from using this dataset is that future students might be discouraged from even trying to pursue a career in sports if the analysis outcome is very pessimistic. However, if an unfair treatment is found, I think showcasing the findings is the key to start having the conversation about how to revert the situation.


## <a name="unknowns"></a> Unknowns and dependencies

There are no factors that I can foresee that would impact my ability to complete the project by the end of the quarter. The dataset is available in a friendly format, and, after a first exploration, data quality seems okay.  

The dataset also covers coed teams, but the data is more sparse for this category, so I will not include it in the analysis.  

At the moment, I don't know if the 2018-19 dataset will be enough for the project, but I have access to the surveys from previous years (found on the same [website](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/datafile/list) as the chosen dataset) if necessary.
